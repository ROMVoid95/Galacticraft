# Galacticraft
This branch of the Galacticraft repo is being refactored out to use [architectury
](https://github.com/architectury), allowing Galacticraft to be compiled for both Fabric and Forge.

# Notice
This branch is **NOT** in a playable state, no jars will be provided. If you want to play using this branch you will need to compile it yourself.
